# KBC-2.O - A Python Project
An interactive Python based quiz game for meme enthusiasts, built using the Tkinter library, that displays a meme after each answer based on correctness. 
Features a dynamic leaderboard that ranks players by the virtual cash they've earned throughout the game

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- How It Works
>Startup and Instructions:
  Upon launching the game, background music plays while the user is shown game instructions.

>Name Entry:
  The user is prompted to enter their name. If skipped, a meme pops up as a humorous reminder. The name is later used for the leaderboard.

>Difficulty Selection via Dice Roll:
  The user rolls a virtual dice to randomly determine the difficulty level of the quiz.

>Quiz Time (10 Questions):
  No time constraintsâ€”this is a fun quiz, not a competitive exam! ðŸ˜„
  After each question, a meme is displayed to keep the tone light-hearted.

>Scoring and Cash System:
  The user receives a score (number of correct answers) and a virtual cash amount based on performance.

>Catch: One wrong answer wipes out all accumulated cash, regardless of how many correct answers preceded it. However, the score remains intact.
  This twist adds excitement and intensity to the game.

>Leaderboard:
  A leaderboard button reveals a popup window displaying the top players sorted by score and cash won. Data is saved to a local CSV file.
